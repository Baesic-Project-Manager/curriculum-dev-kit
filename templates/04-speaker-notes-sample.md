## Slide 1: Title Slide
[1 minute]

**Opening Remarks:**

"Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Module 1 of our Planning series. Tonight we're diving into Planning Fundamentals — the foundational concepts that make everything else in planning work.

I want to start by acknowledging something: planning is one of those topics that can feel either too obvious or too abstract. 'Of course you need a plan.' But the gap between knowing you need a plan and actually creating one that works? That's where most projects run into trouble.

So tonight, we're going to get specific. We'll look at what planning actually involves, why it matters more than most people think, and the components you need to get right from the start."

## Slide 2: Learning Objectives
[2 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Let's look at what you'll be able to do by the end of tonight's session.

First, you'll be able to define planning in concrete terms — not just 'making a plan' but understanding what that actually means in practice.

Second, you'll understand the relationship between planning and execution. These aren't separate activities — they're deeply connected, and understanding that connection changes how you approach both.

Third, you'll be able to identify the six core components of effective planning. These are the building blocks. Miss any of them, and your plan has gaps.

And finally, you'll be able to apply a cost-benefit framework to evaluate whether a project should move forward. Not every project should be approved, and you need tools to make that call.

These aren't theoretical goals. By the end of tonight, you should feel confident applying these concepts in your own work context."

**Transition Cue:**

"Let's start by looking at why planning matters — and I mean really matters, not just in a textbook sense."

## Slide 3: Why Planning Matters
[3 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Here's a statistic that should get your attention: projects with comprehensive planning are 2.5 times more likely to succeed than those that skip or rush the planning phase.

Now, you might be thinking, 'Of course planning helps.' But here's what's interesting — organizations know this, and they still underinvest in planning. Why?

A few reasons. First, there's pressure to show progress. Planning doesn't look like progress to stakeholders who want to see things getting built. Second, planning requires decisions, and decisions are uncomfortable. It's easier to stay vague. Third, planning surfaces problems early — resource constraints, conflicting priorities, unrealistic timelines — and nobody wants to be the bearer of bad news.

But here's the thing: those problems don't go away because you didn't plan for them. They just show up later, when they're more expensive to fix."

**Practical Example:**

"Think about a home renovation project. You could just start knocking down walls and figure it out as you go. But what happens when you hit a load-bearing wall you didn't know about? What happens when you realize halfway through that you can't afford the materials? What happens when the permits you needed take three months you didn't budget for?

Professional projects work the same way, just at larger scale with more at stake."

**Key Takeaway:**

"The cost of planning is always less than the cost of not planning. Always."

**Transition Cue:**

"So if planning is so important, what does it actually involve? Let's break it down into concrete components."

## Slide 8: The Six Components
[4 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"There are six components that define effective planning. I want to be clear upfront: you don't always need all six on every project. Context matters. A small internal initiative doesn't need the same rigor as a multi-million dollar program. But you should know what these are so you can make informed decisions about what to include.

Let's go through them:

**Goals** — What are you trying to achieve, and why does it matter? Goals are about outcomes, not activities. 'Improve customer satisfaction' is a goal. 'Send surveys' is an activity.

**Scope** — What's included, and just as importantly, what's explicitly excluded? Scope creep kills projects not because the additional work is impossible, but because it's unplanned.

**Deliverables** — What tangible outputs will this project produce? Be specific. 'A report' is vague. 'A 10-page analysis with recommendations and implementation timeline' is specific.

**Success Criteria** — How will you know you succeeded? If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.

**Stakeholders** — Who cares about this project, and who can affect it? This is broader than you think. Don't just list the obvious names.

**Resources** — What do you need? Budget, people, time, materials, tools. And critically: are those resources actually available?"

**Key Takeaway:**

"These six components work together. Miss any one, and you've got a gap in your plan. The most common misses? Stakeholders and scope boundaries."

**Transition Cue:**

"Now, some of these components have tricky relationships with each other. Let's look at one of the most commonly confused distinctions: goals versus scope."

---

## Slide 15: Goals vs. Scope
[3-4 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"This is one of the most fundamental distinctions in planning, and it's one that people confuse constantly.

Goals define the 'what' and 'why.' What are you trying to achieve? Why does it matter? Goals are about outcomes and value.

Scope defines the 'how' and boundaries. What work will you do? What won't you do? Scope is about activities and deliverables.

Here's why the confusion happens: goals and scope are related. Your scope should be designed to achieve your goals. But they're not the same thing.

Let me give you an example. Say your goal is 'improve customer satisfaction by 20%.' That's the outcome you want. Your scope might be 'redesign the checkout process, implement a feedback system, and train customer service staff.' Those are the activities you'll do to achieve the goal.

Now, what happens when someone says, 'While we're redesigning checkout, let's also add a loyalty program'? Is that scope creep or goal alignment?

It depends. Does a loyalty program contribute to your 20% satisfaction improvement goal? Maybe. But it wasn't in your original scope, so adding it means more time, more resources, and potentially delayed delivery of your actual goals.

This is where the distinction matters. Goals help you evaluate whether something is worth doing. Scope helps you evaluate whether something is within what you planned to do."

**Key Takeaway:**

"Goals are outcomes. Scope is boundaries. Keep them separate in your planning documents, and you'll avoid half the confusion that derails projects."

**Transition Cue:**

"Now that we understand these components, let's look at a tool that helps us make decisions about whether to proceed at all: cost-benefit analysis."

## Slide 28: Bias Check — Planning Fallacy
[3-4 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Before we wrap up, I want to spend a few minutes on cognitive biases that affect planning. Because even if you understand all the concepts we've covered tonight, your brain can still lead you astray.

The first one is the Planning Fallacy. This is our tendency to underestimate how long things will take and how much they'll cost, even when we have evidence from similar past projects.

Here's what's fascinating: it's not just that we're bad at estimating. It's that we're systematically bad in the same direction. We're always too optimistic. And knowing about the bias doesn't make it go away.

Why does this happen? A few reasons. We focus on the specific case in front of us rather than base rates from similar projects. We underweight things that could go wrong. We want the project to be approved, so we unconsciously shade our estimates toward what sounds reasonable.

The counter-strategy is to use reference class forecasting. Instead of asking 'how long will this project take?', ask 'how long did similar projects actually take?' Then use that as your baseline, not your optimistic estimate."

**Practical Example:**

"Think about the last time you estimated how long something would take. Now think about how long it actually took. Most people find their estimates were 50-100% too optimistic. That's the planning fallacy in action."

**Key Takeaway:**

"Your initial estimate is almost certainly too optimistic. Build in buffers, consult historical data, and assume things will go wrong — because they will."

**Transition Cue:**

"Let's bring everything together with our key takeaways for tonight."

## Slide 31: Key Takeaways
[2-3 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Here's what I want you to remember from tonight:

First: Planning is not optional. Projects that skip planning don't save time — they lose it, with interest.

Second: The six components — goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources — work together. A gap in any one creates a gap in your plan.

Third: Goals and scope are related but different. Goals are outcomes. Scope is boundaries. Keep them separate.

Fourth: Cost-benefit analysis is a tool, not a decision. It informs your judgment, but it doesn't replace it.

And fifth: Your brain works against good planning. Know your biases — especially the planning fallacy — and build in safeguards."

**Closing Remarks:**

"Next session, we'll build on these foundations and look at how to translate planning into execution. We'll cover work breakdown structures, scheduling, and resource allocation — the tactical tools that turn a good plan into a working project.

Thank you for your engagement tonight. I'll stay on for a few minutes if anyone has questions."
