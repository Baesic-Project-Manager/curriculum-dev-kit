# Presentation Development Brief Template

**Purpose:** Complete this document BEFORE building any slides. This brief becomes your production blueprint — follow it during Phase 4.

**Principle:** Content decisions and format decisions are separate concerns. Make all strategic choices here, then execute without deviation.

---

## Module Identification

**Course Title:** {e.g., Professional Certificate Program}

**Module Number & Title:** {e.g., Course 2, Module 1: Introduction to Planning}

**Target Audience:** {e.g., Adult professional learners, career transitioners, upskilling professionals}

**Delivery Format:** {e.g., 90-minute synchronous online session}

**Date Created:** {Date}

**Brief Status:** [ ] Draft | [ ] Under Review | [ ] LOCKED

---

## Timing Calculations

*Work backwards from delivery reality. Be honest about time.*

```
Total session time:           _____ minutes
Minus planned activities:     -_____ minutes
Minus structured discussion:  -_____ minutes
Minus transitions/buffer:     -_____ minutes
= Actual presentation time:   _____ minutes

÷ 2.5 minutes per slide =     _____ slides maximum
```

**Activity Notes:**
- {List any planned activities with time allocations}
- {e.g., "Case study small group discussion: 15 minutes"}
- {e.g., "No formal activities — organic discussion only"}

**Calculated Slide Budget:** _____ slides

---

## Content Structure

*List the major content sections for this module.*

| Section | Topic | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |
| 5 | | |
| 6 | | |

## Priority Rankings & Slide Allocations

*Assign priority AND specific slide counts. Allocations must sum to your slide budget.*

### HIGH Priority — Comprehensive Treatment
*These sections get the most slides, multiple examples, deeper exploration.*

| Section | Topic | Slide Allocation | Justification |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| | | ___ slides | |
| | | ___ slides | |

**HIGH Priority Subtotal:** ___ slides

### MEDIUM Priority — Solid Coverage
*These sections get adequate treatment, key concepts covered.*

| Section | Topic | Slide Allocation | Justification |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| | | ___ slides | |
| | | ___ slides | |

**MEDIUM Priority Subtotal:** ___ slides

### LOW Priority — Overview Only
*These sections get brief treatment, essential points only.*

| Section | Topic | Slide Allocation | Justification |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| | | ___ slides | |
| | | ___ slides | |

**LOW Priority Subtotal:** ___ slides

---

### Allocation Verification

```
HIGH Priority Subtotal:    ___ slides
MEDIUM Priority Subtotal:  ___ slides
LOW Priority Subtotal:     ___ slides
Opening/Closing slides:    ___ slides (typically 3-5)
                           ___________
TOTAL:                     ___ slides

Slide Budget from Timing:  ___ slides

[ ] Allocations match budget
[ ] Adjustments needed: ________________________________

## Mandatory Elements Checklist

*Non-negotiable items that MUST appear in the presentation. Tie each to a reason.*

| Element | Reason/Learning Objective | Target Slide(s) |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Title slide with branding | Professional presentation standard | Slide 1 |
| Learning objectives | Learner orientation | Slide 2 |
| Module overview/roadmap | Navigation and expectations | Slide 3 |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| Key takeaways summary | Retention and closure | Near end |
| Bias check/reflection | Critical thinking application | Final section |

**Additional Mandatory Elements:**
- [ ] Callback to previous session/module? If yes, what: ______________________
- [ ] Specific statistic or data point that must appear: ______________________
- [ ] Specific framework or model that must be introduced: ______________________
- [ ] Connection to certification exam content: ______________________

---

## Case Study / Primary Example Selection

*Choose 1-2 primary examples that will anchor the content. Justify the selection.*

### Primary Case Study

**Name/Title:** {e.g., Well-known project, company initiative, industry example}

**Brief Description:**
{2-3 sentences describing what happened}

**Why This Example:**
- [ ] Recognizable to target audience
- [ ] Illustrates multiple concepts from this module
- [ ] Has clear, documentable outcomes
- [ ] Appropriate complexity for learning level
- [ ] Other: ______________________

**Key Data Points to Include:**
- {e.g., Original budget: $X, Final cost: $Y}
- {e.g., Planned timeline: X months, Actual: Y months}
-

**Slides Where This Appears:** ______________________

## Voice and Tone Definition

### Target Voice
*Describe the instructor persona. Who is speaking?*

{e.g., "Experienced colleague sharing practical wisdom — professional but approachable, honest about challenges, connects theory to workplace reality"}

### Voice Characteristics — DO Include:
- [ ] Direct address to learners ("I want you to consider...")
- [ ] Acknowledgment of real-world complexity
- [ ] Specific metrics and data points
- [ ] Practical examples from professional contexts
- [ ] Honest discussion of limitations and tradeoffs
- [ ] Connection to learner's likely experience
- [ ] Other: ______________________

### Voice Characteristics — AVOID:
- [ ] Vendor marketing language ("revolutionary," "seamless," "cutting-edge")
- [ ] Oversimplification that loses nuance
- [ ] Academic jargon without explanation
- [ ] Condescension toward learners
- [ ] Hedging that undermines confidence ("maybe," "sort of," "I think")
- [ ] Other: ______________________

### Sample Tone Comparison

**AVOID this tone:**
> {Write an example of what NOT to sound like}
> {e.g., "This revolutionary framework will seamlessly transform your outcomes..."}

**USE this tone:**
> {Write an example of the target voice}
> {e.g., "This framework is useful, but let me be honest about its limitations. In my experience..."}

## Bias Check Topics

*Cognitive biases or reflection points to include. These prompt learners to examine their own thinking.*

| Bias/Reflection Topic | Brief Description | Placement |
