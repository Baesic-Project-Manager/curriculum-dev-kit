# Course 2 Module 1: Planning Fundamentals — Topic Outline for Priority Review

**Purpose:** Review current slide structure and assign priorities for January 2025 rework
**Current State:** 47 slides (~94 min) → **Target:** 31-34 slides (~85 min + buffer)
**Action Needed:** Mark each section as HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW priority

## Quick Math

| Metric                          | Value           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Session Duration                | 90 minutes      |
| Buffer (transitions, questions) | 5 minutes       |
| Available Presentation Time     | 85 minutes      |
| Target Slide Count              | 34 slides       |
| **Slides to Cut/Consolidate**   | **13 slides**   |

---

### Section A: Opening & Context (Slides 1-6) — 6 slides

| Slide | Title | Content Summary | PRIORITY |
| ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| 1 | Title | Course branding, module title | Required |
| 2 | Learning Objectives | Four measurable outcomes | Required |
| 3 | Today's Roadmap | Module overview | Required |
| 4 | Why Planning Matters | Statistics on planning impact | High |
| 5 | The Planning Paradox | Why orgs underinvest | Medium |
| 6 | Planning vs. Doing | Common misconceptions | Low |

**Observations:**
- Slides 5-6 could potentially merge into a single slide
- The paradox concept is interesting but may not be essential

**Instructor Notes:**
> "I think the paradox is worth keeping — it resonates with students who come from 'just do it' cultures. But we can definitely combine 5 and 6."

### Section B: Core Components (Slides 7-20) — 14 slides

| Slide | Title | Content Summary | PRIORITY |
| ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| 7 | Six Components Overview | Introduction to the framework | High |
| 8 | Goals — Definition | What goals are | High |
| 9 | Goals — Examples | Good vs bad goals | Medium |
| 10 | Scope — Definition | What scope means | High |
| 11 | Scope — Boundaries | In vs out decisions | High |
| 12 | Scope — Warning | Scope creep intro | Medium |
| 13 | Deliverables — Definition | Tangible outputs | High |
| 14 | Deliverables — Examples | Specificity matters | Medium |
| 15 | Success Criteria | How to know you succeeded | High |
| 16 | Stakeholders — Definition | Who cares and why | High |
| 17 | Stakeholders — Categories | Types of stakeholders | Low |
| 18 | Resources — Definition | Budget, people, time | High |
| 19 | Resources — Constraints | Reality of limitations | Medium |
| 20 | Components Summary | Recap of all six | Medium |

**Observations:**
- This section has the most consolidation opportunity
- Definition + Examples slides could merge for each component
- Stakeholder categories (slide 17) may be too detailed for this level
- Summary slide may be redundant if we have good transitions

**Instructor Notes:**
> "I don't want a 'slide for every term' if that makes sense? The overview slide (7) is key, then we can be more efficient with the individual components. Skip slide 17 entirely — we cover stakeholder categories in depth in Module 3."

---

### Section C: Goals vs. Scope (Slides 21-27) — 7 slides

| Slide | Title | Content Summary | PRIORITY |
| ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| 21 | The Confusion | Why people mix these up | High |
| 22 | Goals Defined | Outcomes and value | High |
| 23 | Scope Defined | Activities and boundaries | High |
| 24 | Side by Side | Comparison chart | High |
| 25 | Example: Checkout Redesign | Applied to real scenario | High |
| 26 | Scope Creep Test | Is it goals or scope? | Medium |
| 27 | Key Takeaway | Bottom line distinction | Medium |

**Observations:**
- This section is well-structured but slightly redundant
- Slides 21-23 could become 2 slides with careful design
- Example (25) is essential and should stay

**Instructor Notes:**
> "This is the most important distinction in the whole module. Don't cut too much here. But the 'confusion' slide can be shorter — I usually just mention it and move on."

---

### Section D: Cost-Benefit Analysis (Slides 28-40) — 13 slides

| Slide | Title | Content Summary | PRIORITY |
| ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| 28 | Section Header | Transition to CBA | Low |
| 29 | Why CBA | Decision-making tool | High |
| 30 | Components of CBA | What goes in | High |
| 31 | Tangible Costs | Direct expenses | Medium |
| 32 | Intangible Costs | Hidden impacts | Medium |
| 33 | Tangible Benefits | Direct gains | Medium |
| 34 | Intangible Benefits | Harder to quantify | Medium |
| 35 | The Formula | ROI calculation | High |
| 36 | Example Part 1 | Setting up the scenario | High |
| 37 | Example Part 2 | Running the numbers | High |
| 38 | Example Part 3 | Making the decision | High |
| 39 | Limitations | When CBA isn't enough | Medium |
| 40 | CBA Summary | Key points | Low |

**Observations:**
- Slides 31-34 (4 slides on costs/benefits types) could become 1-2 slides
- The example (36-38) is good but 3 slides may be excessive
- Section header (28) is unnecessary if we have good transitions
- Summary (40) is likely redundant

**Instructor Notes:**
> "The example is critical — students struggle with the math. Keep all three example slides. But you're right about the cost/benefit type slides — make it a single comparison slide. Drop the summary; I'll recap verbally."

---

### Section E: Closing (Slides 41-47) — 7 slides

| Slide | Title | Content Summary | PRIORITY |
| ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| 41 | Bias Check: Planning Fallacy | Time estimation bias | High |
| 42 | Bias Check: Anchoring | First number sticks | Medium |
| 43 | Sources | Citations | Required |
| 44 | Reflection Question | Integration prompt | Low |
| 45 | Next Session Preview | What's coming | Required |
| 46 | Key Takeaways | Summary points | Required |
| 47 | Thank You | Closing | Low |

**Observations:**
- Two bias checks may be too many — pick one
- Reflection question (44) is rarely used effectively
- Thank you slide (47) is unnecessary

**Instructor Notes:**
> "Keep the Planning Fallacy — it's the most relevant. Drop anchoring and the reflection question. I always end with key takeaways anyway."

## Instructor Decision Points

### 1. Planning Paradox Coverage
- [x] Keep slide 5 (paradox) and merge slide 6 into it
- [ ] Delete both and jump to components faster
- [ ] Other: _______________

### 2. Component Treatment
- [x] Overview slide + condensed per-component slides
- [ ] Overview slide only (explain verbally)
- [ ] Other: _______________

### 3. Cost-Benefit Example Length
- [x] Keep all 3 example slides (36-38)
- [ ] Condense to 2 slides
- [ ] Condense to 1 slide
- [ ] Other: _______________

### 4. Bias Check
- [x] Planning Fallacy only
- [ ] Both biases
- [ ] Different bias: _______________

### 5. Any sections to ADD depth to?
> "Goals vs. Scope needs the most attention. Students always struggle here. Make sure the example is crystal clear and the takeaway is memorable."
