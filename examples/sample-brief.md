## Timing Calculations

```
Total session time:           90 minutes
Minus planned activities:     -0 minutes (organic discussion only)
Minus structured discussion:  -0 minutes
Minus transitions/buffer:     -5 minutes
= Actual presentation time:   85 minutes

÷ 2.5 minutes per slide =     34 slides maximum
```

**Activity Notes:**
- No formal breakout activities for this session
- Discussion happens organically within content delivery
- Buffer accounts for Q&A and technical adjustments

**Calculated Slide Budget:** 34 slides

## Priority Rankings & Slide Allocations

### HIGH Priority — Comprehensive Treatment

| Section | Topic | Slide Allocation | Justification |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| B | Six Core Components | 8 slides | Foundational framework; everything else builds on this |
| C | Goals vs. Scope | 5 slides | Most common confusion point; requires clarity |
| D | Cost-Benefit Example | 4 slides | Students struggle with practical application |

**HIGH Priority Subtotal:** 17 slides

### MEDIUM Priority — Solid Coverage

| Section | Topic | Slide Allocation | Justification |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| A | Why Planning Matters | 3 slides | Context setting but not primary teaching |
| D | CBA Concepts | 4 slides | Theory before example; necessary but not deep |
| E | Bias Check | 2 slides | One bias with application |

**MEDIUM Priority Subtotal:** 9 slides

### LOW Priority — Overview Only

| Section | Topic | Slide Allocation | Justification |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| A | Context slides | 1 slide | Merged paradox concept |
| D | CBA Limitations | 1 slide | Brief mention only |

**LOW Priority Subtotal:** 2 slides

### Allocation Verification

```
HIGH Priority Subtotal:    17 slides
MEDIUM Priority Subtotal:   9 slides
LOW Priority Subtotal:      2 slides
Opening/Closing slides:     5 slides (title, objectives, roadmap, sources, takeaways)
                           ___________
TOTAL:                     33 slides

Slide Budget from Timing:  34 slides

[x] Allocations match budget (1 slide buffer)
```

## Case Study Selection

### Primary Case Study

**Name/Title:** E-Commerce Checkout Redesign Project

**Brief Description:**
A mid-size retail company decided to redesign their checkout process after seeing high cart abandonment rates. The project illustrates goals (reduce abandonment by 30%), scope (checkout only, not full site), and the cost-benefit analysis that led to approval.

**Why This Example:**
- [x] Recognizable to target audience (everyone has abandoned an online cart)
- [x] Illustrates multiple concepts from this module
- [x] Has clear, documentable outcomes
- [x] Appropriate complexity for learning level

**Key Data Points to Include:**
- Original abandonment rate: 68%
- Target rate: 38% (30% reduction)
- Project cost: $180,000
- Projected annual benefit: $540,000
- Actual first-year benefit: $620,000

**Slides Where This Appears:** Goals vs Scope (slide 24), CBA Example (slides 29-31)

## Voice and Tone Definition

### Target Voice
Experienced colleague sharing practical wisdom — professional but approachable, honest about challenges, connects theory to workplace reality without being preachy.

### Voice Characteristics — DO Include:
- [x] Direct address to learners ("You'll encounter this when...")
- [x] Acknowledgment of real-world complexity
- [x] Specific metrics and data points
- [x] Practical examples from professional contexts
- [x] Honest discussion of limitations ("This framework works, but...")
- [x] Connection to learner's likely experience

### Voice Characteristics — AVOID:
- [x] Vendor marketing language ("revolutionary," "seamless")
- [x] Oversimplification that loses nuance
- [x] Academic jargon without explanation
- [x] Condescension toward learners
- [x] Hedging that undermines confidence

### Sample Tone Comparison

**AVOID this tone:**
> "Cost-benefit analysis is a powerful tool that will transform your decision-making capabilities and enable seamless project approval processes."

**USE this tone:**
> "Cost-benefit analysis is useful, but let me be honest: the numbers never tell the whole story. What I want you to understand is how to use it as one input to a decision, not the decision itself."

## Bias Check Topics

| Bias/Reflection Topic | Brief Description | Placement |

| Planning Fallacy | Systematic underestimation of time and cost | Dedicated slide near end |
| Counter-strategy | Use reference class forecasting | Same slide, practical application |

**Bias Check Format:**
- [x] Dedicated slide at end of presentation
