## Slide 4: Why Planning Matters
[3 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Let me start with a number that should get your attention: projects with comprehensive planning are 2.5 times more likely to succeed than those that skip or rush the planning phase.

Now, you might be thinking, 'Of course planning helps — that's obvious.' But here's what's interesting: organizations know this, and they still underinvest in planning. Why?

A few reasons I've seen. First, there's pressure to show progress. Planning doesn't look like progress to stakeholders who want to see things getting built. 'We're still planning' sounds like 'we're not doing anything.' Second, planning requires decisions, and decisions are uncomfortable. It's easier to stay vague. Third — and this is the big one — planning surfaces problems early. Resource constraints, conflicting priorities, unrealistic timelines. Nobody wants to be the bearer of bad news.

But here's what I want you to understand: those problems don't go away because you didn't plan for them. They just show up later, when they're more expensive to fix."

**Key Takeaway:**

"The cost of planning is always less than the cost of not planning. Always."

**Transition Cue:**

"So if planning is so important, what does it actually involve? Let's break it down into six concrete components."

## Slide 7: Six Components Overview
[2-3 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"There are six components that define effective planning. I want to be clear upfront: you don't always need all six on every project. Context matters. A small internal initiative doesn't need the same rigor as a multi-million dollar program.

But you should know what these are so you can make informed decisions about what to include — and what to skip.

The six are: Goals, Scope, Deliverables, Success Criteria, Stakeholders, and Resources.

We're going to go through each one, but I want you to think of them as a system, not a checklist. They connect to each other. Your goals inform your scope. Your scope determines your deliverables. Your deliverables shape your success criteria. And all of it depends on having the right stakeholders identified and the right resources available.

Miss any one component, and you've got a gap in your plan. The most common misses? Stakeholders — people always underestimate who cares about their project — and scope boundaries, which is what we'll spend extra time on today."

**Transition Cue:**

"Let's start with goals — what you're actually trying to achieve."

## Slide 14: Goals vs. Scope — The Distinction
[3-4 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"This is one of the most fundamental distinctions in planning, and it's one that people confuse constantly. I've seen experienced project managers mix these up.

Goals define the 'what' and 'why.' What are you trying to achieve? Why does it matter? Goals are about outcomes and value.

Scope defines the 'how' and 'boundaries.' What work will you do? What won't you do? Scope is about activities and deliverables.

Here's why the confusion happens: goals and scope are related. Your scope should be designed to achieve your goals. But they're not the same thing.

Let me give you an example. Say your goal is 'improve customer satisfaction by 20%.' That's the outcome you want. Your scope might be 'redesign the checkout process, implement a feedback system, and train customer service staff.' Those are the activities you'll do to achieve the goal.

Now, what happens when someone says, 'While we're redesigning checkout, let's also add a loyalty program'? Is that scope creep or goal alignment?

It depends. Does a loyalty program contribute to your 20% satisfaction improvement goal? Maybe. But it wasn't in your original scope, so adding it means more time, more resources, and potentially delayed delivery of your actual goals.

This is where the distinction matters. Goals help you evaluate whether something is worth doing. Scope helps you evaluate whether something is within what you planned to do."

**Key Takeaway:**

"Goals are outcomes. Scope is boundaries. Keep them separate in your planning documents, and you'll avoid half the confusion that derails projects."

**Transition Cue:**

"Let's make this concrete with our checkout redesign example."

## Slide 24: Checkout Redesign — Applied
[3 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Let's walk through our checkout redesign example and see how goals and scope play out in practice.

The company's goal was clear: reduce cart abandonment by 30%. At the time, 68% of customers who added items to their cart never completed a purchase. That's a lot of lost revenue.

Notice what the goal isn't. It's not 'redesign the checkout.' That's an activity, not an outcome. The outcome is reduced abandonment. The redesign is how you get there.

Now, the scope. The team defined their scope as: the checkout flow only. From the moment you click 'checkout' to the order confirmation page. That's it.

What was explicitly out of scope? The product pages. The search function. The account system. The mobile app — at least initially. Even though all of those things might affect whether someone buys, they weren't in this project's scope.

Why such tight boundaries? Resources. They had 12 weeks and a team of four. If they tried to touch everything, they'd finish nothing. By constraining scope, they could actually deliver something."

**Practical Example:**

"Here's where it got interesting. Two weeks in, someone suggested, 'We should also add Apple Pay.' Good idea? Probably. But it wasn't in the original scope. The project manager had to ask: does this serve our goal? Yes — easier payment might reduce abandonment. Can we add it within our constraints? Barely, but yes.

They added it, but they documented the scope change and adjusted the timeline by one week. That's healthy scope management. The change served the goal and was handled deliberately."

**Key Takeaway:**

"The goal gave them a way to evaluate the change. The scope gave them boundaries to protect. You need both."

**Transition Cue:**

"This brings us to the tool that helped them make the original decision to fund this project: cost-benefit analysis."

## Slide 30: Bias Check — Planning Fallacy
[3-4 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Before we wrap up, I want to spend time on something that will undermine everything we've discussed today if you're not careful: cognitive biases.

Specifically, the Planning Fallacy. This is our systematic tendency to underestimate how long things will take and how much they'll cost — even when we have evidence from similar past projects.

Here's what's fascinating: it's not just that we're bad at estimating. It's that we're systematically bad in the same direction. We're always too optimistic. And knowing about the bias doesn't make it go away. I know about it, and I still do it.

Why does this happen? A few reasons. We focus on the specific case in front of us rather than base rates from similar projects. 'This project is different.' We underweight things that could go wrong. And — let's be honest — we want the project to be approved, so we unconsciously shade our estimates toward what sounds reasonable.

The counter-strategy is called reference class forecasting. Instead of asking 'how long will this project take?', you ask 'how long did similar projects actually take?' Then you use that data as your baseline, not your optimistic internal estimate.

If five similar checkout redesigns took 14-18 weeks, and you're estimating 12, you should probably reconsider."

**Practical Example:**

"Think about the last time you estimated how long something would take — a work project, even just a home repair. Now think about how long it actually took. Most people find their estimates were 50-100% too optimistic. That's the planning fallacy in action, and it affects everyone."

**Key Takeaway:**

"Your initial estimate is almost certainly too optimistic. Build in buffers, consult historical data, and assume things will go wrong — because they will."

**Transition Cue:**

"Let's bring everything together with our key takeaways."

## Slide 33: Key Takeaways
[2-3 minutes]

**Content Delivery:**

"Here's what I want you to remember from tonight:

First: Planning is not optional. Projects that skip planning don't save time — they lose it, with interest.

Second: The six components — goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources — work together. A gap in any one creates a gap in your plan.

Third: Goals and scope are related but different. Goals are outcomes. Scope is boundaries. Keep them separate.

Fourth: Cost-benefit analysis is a tool, not a decision. It informs your judgment, but it doesn't replace it.

And fifth: Your brain works against good planning. Know your biases — especially the planning fallacy — and build in safeguards."

**Closing Remarks:**

"Next session, we'll build on these foundations and look at how to translate plans into execution. We'll cover work breakdown structures, scheduling, and resource allocation — the tactical tools that turn a good plan into a working project.

Thank you for your engagement tonight. I'll stay on for a few minutes if anyone has questions."
